TestNG (Test Next Generation) is a testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit, designed for test automation in Java.
Features of TestNG:
1. Annotations (@Test, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, etc.) help define the test flow.
2. Supports parallel execution of tests for efficiency.
3. Generates detailed HTML reports of test execution.
4. Supports grouping and prioritization of test cases.
5. Integrates seamlessly with Selenium for automated testing.
TestNG simplifies test case execution and provides better control over the testing process.
